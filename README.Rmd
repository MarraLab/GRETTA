## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* genetic interactions

*ARID1A* encodes a member of the chromatin remodeling SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex and is a frequently mutated gene in cancer. It is known that *ARID1A* and its homolog, *ARID1B*, are synthetic lethal to one another: The dual loss of ARID1A and its homolog, ARID1B, in a cell is lethal; however, the loss of either gene alone is not  ([Helming et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3480)). This example will demonstrate how we can identify synthetic lethal interactors of *ARID1A* using `GRETA` and predict this known interaction.

For this example you will need to call the following libraries

```{r libraries, eval = Final_eval}
library(tidyverse)
library(GRETA)
```

Then, assign a variable that points to where the `.rda` files are stored.

```{r data_path, eval = FALSE}
GRETA_data_dir <- "/path/to/GRETA_project/data/"
```

### Exploring cell lines 

One way to explore cell lines that are available in DepMap is through their [portal](https://depmap.org/portal/). However, there are some simple built-in methods in GRETA to provide users with a way to glimpse the data using the series of `list_available` functions: `list_available_mutations()`, `list_available_cancer_types()`, `list_available_cancer_subtypes()`

Current DepMap data used by default is version 20Q1, which contains whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing annotations for `1775` cancer cell lines (`1270` cell lines with RNA-seq data, `378` cell lines with quantitative proteomics data, and `739` cell lines with CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen data)

```{r listing_available_muts, eval = FALSE}
# Find ARID1A hotspot mutations detected in all cell lines
list_available_mutations(Gene = "ARID1A", Is_hotspot = TRUE, data_dir = GRETA_data_dir) 
```

```{r listing_available_cancer_types, eval = Final_eval}
# List all available cancer types
list_available_cancer_types(data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)

# List all available cancer subtypes
list_available_cancer_subtypes(input_disease = "Lung Cancer", data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)
```

### Selecting mutant and control cell line groups

As default `select_cell_lines()` will identify cancer cell lines with loss-of-function alterations in the gene specified and group them into six different groups. 

Loss-of-function alterations include variants that are annotated as: `"Nonsense_Mutation", "Frame_Shift_Ins", "Splice_Site", "De_novo_Start_OutOfFrame", "Frame_Shift_Del", "Start_Codon_SNP", "Start_Codon_Del",` and `"Start_Codon_Ins"`. Copy number alterations are also taken into consideration and group as `"Deep_del", "Loss", "Neutral",` or `"Amplified"`.

The cell line groups assigned by default are:

* `Control` cell lines do not harbor any single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or insertions and deletions (InDels) with a neutral copy number (CN).
* `HomDel` cell lines harbor one or more homozygous deleterious SNVs or have deep CN loss.
* `T-HetDel` cell lines harbor two or more heterozygous deleterious SNVs/InDels with neutral or CN loss.
* `HetDel` cell lines harbor one heterozygous deleterious SNV/InDel with neutral CN, or no SNV/InDel with CN loss.
* `Amplified` cell lines harbor no SNVs/InDels with increased CN.
* `Others` cell lines harbor deleterious SNVs with increased CN.


```{r select_groups, eval = Final_eval}
ARID1A_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_groups, Group)
```
#### Optional filter for specific cancer types

```{r select_groups_option, eval = Final_eval}
# Find pancreatic cancer cell lines with ARID1A mutations
ARID1A_pancr_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", 
                                         Input_disease = "Pancreatic Cancer",
                                         data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_pancr_groups, Group)
```

### Check for differential expression 

Of the three mutant cancer cell line groups `ARID1A_HomDel`, `ARID1A_T-HetDel`, and `ARID1A_HetDel`, cancer cell lines with `ARID1A_HomDel` mutations are most likely to result in a loss or reduced expression of *ARID1A*. Therefore, we want to check whether cell lines in `ARID1A_HomDel` mutant group have significantly less *ARID1A* RNA or protein expression compared to control cell lines.

```{r Check_expression_rna, eval = Final_eval}
# Select only HomDel and Control cell lines
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel", "Control"))

# Get RNA expression 
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna <- extract_rna_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls$DepMap_ID, 
  Input_genes = "ARID1A",
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)
```

Not all cell lines contain RNA and/or protein expression profiles, and not all proteins were detected by mass spectrometer. (Details on data generation can be found on the [DepMap site](https://depmap.org/portal/).)

```{r Check_expression_protein, eval = FALSE}
# Get protein expression
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_protein <- extract_protein_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls$DepMap_ID,
  Input_genes = "ARID1A",
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)

# Produces an error message since ARID1A protein data is not available
```
Using Welch's t-test, we can check to see whether *ARID1A* RNA expression (in TPM) is significantly reduced in `ARID1A_HomDel` cell lines compared to `Controls`. 

```{r Check_expression_rna_stats, eval = Final_eval}
# Append groups and test differential expression
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna <- left_join(
  ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna,
  ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls %>% select(DepMap_ID, Group)) %>%
  mutate(Group = fct_relevel(Group,"Control")) # show Control group first

# T-test 
t.test(ARID1A_8289 ~ Group, ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna)

# plot 
ggplot(ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna, aes(x = Group, y = ARID1A_8289)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Perform *in silico* genetic screen

After determining cell lines in the `ARID1A_HomDel` group has statistically significant reduction in RNA expression compared to `Control` cell lines, the next step is to perform a *in silico* genetic screen using `screen_results()`. This uses the dependency probabilities (or **"lethality probabilities"**) generated from DepMap's genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen. 

**Lethality probabilities** range from 0.0 to 1.0 and is quantified for each gene knock out in every cancer cell line screened (There are 18,334 genes targeted in 739 cancer cell lines). A gene knock out with a lethality probability of 0.0 indicates a non-essential for the cell line, and a gene knock out with a 1.0 indicates an essential gene (ie. very lethal). Details can be found in [Meyers, R., et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3984)

At its core, `screen_results()` performs multiple Mann-Whitney U tests, comparing lethality probabilities of each targeted gene between mutant and control groups. This generates a data frame with the following columns:

* `GeneName_ID` - Hugo symbol with NCBI gene ID
* `GeneNames` - Hugo symbol
* `_median, _mean, _sd, _iqr` - Control and mutant group's median, mean, standard deviation (sd), and interquartile range (iqr) of dependency probabilities. Dependency probabilities range from zero to one, where one indicates a essential gene (ie. KO of gene was lethal) and zero indicates a non-essential gene (KO of gene was not lethal)
* `Pval` - P-value from Mann Whitney U test between control and mutant groups.
* `Adj_pval` - BH-adjusted P-value.
* `log2FC_by_median` - Log2 normalized median fold change of dependency probabilities (mutant / control).
* `log2FC_by_mean` - Log2 normalized mean fold change of dependency probabilities (mutant / control).
* `CliffDelta` - Cliff's delta non-parametric effect size between mutant and control dependency probabilities. Ranges between -1 to 1.
* `dip_pval` - Hartigan's dip test p-value. Tests whether distribution of mutant dependency probability is unimodel. If dip test is rejected (p-value < 0.05), this indicates that there is a multimodel dependency probability distribution and that there may be another factor contributing to this separation.
* `Interaction_score` - Combined value generated from signed p-values: -log10(Pval) \* sign(log2FC_by_median). Negative scores indicate lethal genetic interaction, and positive scores indicate alleviating genetic interaction.

```{r run_screen, eval = FALSE}
ARID1A_mutant_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)
ARID1A_control_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("Control")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)

# This can take several hours depending on number of lines/cores used. Best to run this overnight.
screen_results <- GI_screen(
  control_IDs = ARID1A_control_IDs, 
  mutant_IDs = ARID1A_mutant_IDs,
  core_num = 5, # depends on how many cores you have  
  output_dir = "path/to/results/folder/", # Will save your results here as well as in the variable
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir,
  test = FALSE) # use TRUE to run a short test to make sure all will run overnight.
```

```{r load_prepared_results, eval = Final_eval, include = FALSE}
# Load prepared ARID1A screen result
load(paste0(GRETA_data_dir,"/sample_ARID1A_KO_screen.rda"), envir = environment())
screen_results <- sample_ARID1A_KO_screen
```

We can quickly determine whether any lethal genetic interactions were predicted by `GRETA`. We use a `Pval` cut off of 0.05 and rank based on the `Interaction_score`. 

```{r checkout_res, eval = Final_eval}
screen_results %>% 
  filter(Pval < 0.05) %>%
  arrange(-Interaction_score) %>% 
  select(GeneNames:Mutant_median, Pval, Interaction_score) %>% head
```

We immediately see that *ARID1B*, a known synthetic lethal interaction of *ARID1A*, was a the top of this list.

### Visualize screen results

Finally once the *in silico* screen is complete, results can be quickly visualized using `plot_screen()`. Positive genetic interaction scores indicate potential synthetic lethal genetic interactors, and negative scores indicate potential alleviating genetic interactors. As expected, we identified *ARID1B* as a synthetic lethal interactor of *ARID1A*.

```{r plot, eval = Final_eval}
# Visualize results, turn on gene labels, 
# and label three genes each that are predicted to have 
# lethal and alleviating genetic interactions, respectively

plot_screen(result_df = screen_results, 
            label_genes = TRUE, 
            label_n = 3)
```

## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* co-essential genes

Perturbing genes that function in same/synergistic pathways or in the same complex are said to show similar fitness effects, and these that show effects are considered to be "co-essential". The strategy of mapping co-essential gene have been used by several studies to attribute functions to previously annotated genes as well as to identify a novel subunit of a large complex ([Wainberg et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00840-z); [Pan et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.04.011)). 

Given that ARID1A is known subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex ([Mashtalir et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.032)), we expect that members of the SWI/SNF complex would share co-essentiality with *ARID1A*. This example will demonstrate how we can map *ARID1A*'s co-essential gene network using `GRETA`.

## Identifying genes with highest correlation coefficients

To determine co-essential genes, we will perform multiple Pearson correlation coefficient analyses between *ARID1A* KO effects and the KO effects of all 18,333 genes. A cut off will be determined by calculating the inflection point of the ranked coefficient curve. As expected find SWI/SNF subunit encoding genes, *SMARCE1* and *SMARCB1*, as the top two co-essential genes.

```{r load_prepared_results_coess, eval = Final_eval, include = FALSE}
load(paste0(GRETA_data_dir,"/sample_ARID1A_coessential_result.rda"), envir = environment())
load(paste0(GRETA_data_dir,"/sample_ARID1A_coessential_inflection.rda"), envir = environment())
coess_df <- sample_ARID1A_coessential_result
coess_inflection_df <- inflection_df 
```

```{r coess_df, eval = FALSE}
# Map co-essential genes
coess_df <- coessential_map(
  Input_gene = "ARID1A", 
  core_num = 5, 
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir, 
  output_dir = "path/to/results/folder/",
  test = FALSE)

# Calculate inflection points of positive and negative curve using co-essential gene results.
coess_inflection_df <- get_inflection_points(coess_df)
```

Next, we annotate the data frame containing the co-essential network data and visualize. 

```{r combine_n_visualize, eval = Final_eval}
# Combine and annotate data frame containing co-essential genes
coess_annotated_df <- annotate_coessential_df(coess_df, coess_inflection_df)

plot_coessential_genes(
  result_df = coess_annotated_df, 
  inflection_df = coess_inflection_df,
  label_genes = TRUE, # Should gene names be labeled?
  label_n = 3) # Number of genes to display from each end
```

We also see that the top ten *ARID1A* co-essential genes include eight known SWI/SNF subunits, namely *ARID1A*, *SMARCE1*, *SMARCB1*, *SMARCC1*, *DPF2*, *SS18*, *SMARCC2*, and *SMARCD2*.

```{r top10_coess, eval = Final_eval}
# Show top 10 co-essential genes. 
coess_annotated_df %>% arrange(Rank) %>% head(10)
```

## Session Info 
```{r sessioninfo}
sessionInfo()
```
