# GRETA 0.6.0

- Version 0.5.0 was submitted to Bioinformatics and version 0.6.0 addresses several reviewer comments (detailed below).
- Upon loading GRETA into R, a welcome message is displayed to indicate package version and the latest DepMap data set that is available. 
- Function arguments are now all lower case.
- `GI_screen()` has a new argument `gene_list = ` to allow small-scale GI screens and reduce computational time. 
- Default pan-cancer `coessential_map()` now uses pre-computed cor matrix to reduce computational time. This matrix is provided along with the DepMap data.
- A vignette is now available and in a Bioconductor format to prepare for submission (same as readme). 
- GRETA is now GRETTA (with two T's) due conflict with existing package on CRAN.

# GRETA 0.5.0

- Default output file name from `GI_screen()` has been renamed.
- Singularity definition file and tutorial file has been included as a supplement.

# GRETA 0.4.1

-   Users can now custom name their output files in `GI_screen()` and `coessential_map()` with the `output_filename =` option. 
-   Technically I think this should be a minor version update, but it seemed too insignificant to go to v0.5.0. 

# GRETA 0.4.0

-   All GRETA functions are now compatible with multiple DepMap data versions (20Q1, 21Q4, and 22Q2)! 
-   An FAQ section is now available [here](https://github.com/ytakemon/GRETA/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

# GRETA 0.3.2

-   GINIR package name has now changed to GRETA (Genetic inteRaction and EssenTially mApper).
-   `GINI_screen()` is now `GI_screen()`
-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
-   Back filled log for previous releases

# GINIR 0.3.1

# GINIR 0.3.0

-   This minor feature improvement now shows cell line IDs while listing all available mutations using `list_available_mutations()`.

# GINIR 0.2.0

-   First stable release of GINIR
-   Contains citable DOI generated by Zenodo
-   Users can now refer to the README page for a full tutorial of the tool and most up to date news.
