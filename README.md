# GINIscreenR

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

GINIscreenR leverages data generated by the [Cancer Dependency Map
(DepMap) project](https://depmap.org/portal/) to identify cancer cell
lines with mutations of interest and performs in-silico genetic
interaction network identification (GINI) screens. A manuscript
describing the process is being prepared.

Current DepMap version is 20Q1 and was downloaded through the DepMap
data portal. The data was distributed and used under the terms and
conditions of [CC Atribution 4.0
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of GINIscreenR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("GINIscreenR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ytakemon/GINIscreenR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(GINIscreenR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
