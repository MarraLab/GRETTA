## Workflows

### Genetic interaction mapping

1.  Install `GRETA` and download accompanying data.
2.  Select mutant cell lines that carry mutations in the gene of
    interest and control cell lines.
    -   ([optional
        specifications](https://github.com/ytakemon/GRETA/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#q-how-can-context-specific-genetic-screens-or-essentiality-network-analyses-be-performed))
        can be used to select cell lines based on disease type, disease
        subtype, or amino acid change.
3.  Determine differential expression between mutant and control cell
    line groups.
    -   (optional but recommended).
4.  Perform *in silico* genetic screen.
5.  Visualize results.

### Co-essential network mapping

1.  Install `GRETA` and download accompanying data.
2.  Run correlation coefficient analysis.
    -   ([optional
        specifications](https://github.com/ytakemon/GRETA/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#q-how-can-context-specific-genetic-screens-or-essentiality-network-analyses-be-performed:~:text=For%20the%20essentiality%20network%20analysis%2C%20context%2Dspecific%20cell%20lines%20can%20be%20selected%20in%20two%20ways%3A))
        can be used to perform analysis on cell lines of a specific
        disease type(s).
3.  Calculate inflection points of negative/positive curve to determine
    a threshold.
4.  Apply threshold.
5.  Visualize results.

## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* genetic interactions

*ARID1A* encodes a member of the chromatin remodeling SWItch/Sucrose
Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex and is a frequently mutated gene in
cancer. It is known that *ARID1A* and its homolog, *ARID1B*, are
synthetic lethal to one another: The dual loss of ARID1A and its
homolog, ARID1B, in a cell is lethal; however, the loss of either gene
alone is not ([Helming et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3480)).
This example will demonstrate how we can identify synthetic lethal
interactors of *ARID1A* using `GRETA` and predict this known
interaction.

For this example you will need to call the following libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
#> ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──
#> ✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 
#> ✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10
#> ✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 
#> ✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 
#> ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
#> ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
#> ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
library(GRETA)
```

Then, assign variable that point to where the `.rda` files are stored
and where result files should go.

``` r
greta_data_dir <- "/path/to/GRETA_project/data/"
greta_output_dir <- "/path/to/results/folder/"
```

### Exploring cell lines

One way to explore cell lines that are available in DepMap is through
their [portal](https://depmap.org/portal/). However, there are some
simple built-in methods in GRETA to provide users with a way to glimpse
the data using the series of `list_available` functions:
`list_available_mutations()`, `list_available_cancer_types()`,
`list_available_cancer_subtypes()`

Current DepMap data used by default is version 22Q2, which contains
whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing annotations for `1771`
cancer cell lines (`1406` cell lines with RNA-seq data, `375` cell lines
with quantitative proteomics data, and `1086` cell lines with
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen data)

``` r
# Find ARID1A hotspot mutations detected in all cell lines
list_available_mutations(Gene = "ARID1A", Is_hotspot = TRUE, data_dir = greta_data_dir) 
```

``` r
# List all available cancer types

### Selecting mutant and control cell line groups

As default `select_cell_lines()` will identify cancer cell lines with
loss-of-function alterations in the gene specified and group them into
six different groups.

Loss-of-function alterations include variants that are annotated as:
`"Nonsense_Mutation", "Frame_Shift_Ins", "Splice_Site", "De_novo_Start_OutOfFrame", "Frame_Shift_Del", "Start_Codon_SNP", "Start_Codon_Del",`
and `"Start_Codon_Ins"`. Copy number alterations are also taken into
consideration and group as `"Deep_del", "Loss", "Neutral",` or
`"Amplified"`.

The cell line groups assigned by default are:

-   `Control` cell lines do not harbor any single nucleotide variations
    (SNVs) or insertions and deletions (InDels) with a neutral copy
    number (CN).
-   `HomDel` cell lines harbor one or more homozygous deleterious SNVs
    or have deep CN loss.
-   `T-HetDel` cell lines harbor two or more heterozygous deleterious
    SNVs/InDels with neutral or CN loss.
-   `HetDel` cell lines harbor one heterozygous deleterious SNV/InDel
    with neutral CN, or no SNV/InDel with CN loss.
-   `Amplified` cell lines harbor no SNVs/InDels with increased CN.
-   `Others` cell lines harbor deleterious SNVs with increased CN.

``` r
ARID1A_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", data_dir = greta_data_dir)
#> Selecting mutant groups for: ARID1A in all cancer cell lines

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_groups, Group)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   Group               n
#>   <chr>           <int>
#> 1 ARID1A_HetDel      61
#> 2 ARID1A_HomDel      23
#> 3 ARID1A_T-HetDel    30
#> 4 Control           906
#> 5 Others             66
```

#### Optional filter for specific cancer types

``` r
# Find pancreatic cancer cell lines with ARID1A mutations
ARID1A_pancr_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", 
                                         Input_disease = "Pancreatic Cancer",
                                         data_dir = greta_data_dir)
#> Selecting mutant groups for: ARID1A in Pancreatic Cancer,  cell lines

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_pancr_groups, Group)
#> # A tibble: 4 × 2
#>   Group             n
#>   <chr>         <int>
#> 1 ARID1A_HetDel     5
#> 2 ARID1A_HomDel     4
#> 3 Control          36
#> 4 Others            2
```

### Check for differential expression

Of the three mutant cancer cell line groups `ARID1A_HomDel`,
`ARID1A_T-HetDel`, and `ARID1A_HetDel`, cancer cell lines with
`ARID1A_HomDel` mutations are most likely to result in a loss or reduced
expression of *ARID1A*. Therefore, we want to check whether cell lines
in `ARID1A_HomDel` mutant group have significantly less *ARID1A* RNA or
protein expression compared to control cell lines.

``` r
# Select only HomDel and Control cell lines
ARID1A_groups_subset <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel", "Control"))

# Get RNA expression 
ARID1A_rna_expr <- extract_rna_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_groups_subset$DepMap_ID, 
  Input_genes = "ARID1A",
  data_dir = greta_data_dir)
#> [1] "Following sample did not contain profile data: ACH-000047, ACH-000426, ACH-000658, ACH-000979, ACH-001039, ACH-001063, ACH-001065, ACH-001107, ACH-001126, ACH-001137, ACH-001205, ACH-001212, ACH-001227, ACH-001331, ACH-001544, ACH-001606, ACH-001639, ACH-001675, ACH-001955, ACH-001956, ACH-001957, ACH-002083, ACH-002106, ACH-002109, ACH-002110, ACH-002114, ACH-002116, ACH-002119, ACH-002140, ACH-002141, ACH-002143, ACH-002150, ACH-002156, ACH-002160, ACH-002161, ACH-002179, ACH-002181, ACH-002186, ACH-002189, ACH-002198, ACH-002202, ACH-002210, ACH-002212, ACH-002217, ACH-002228, ACH-002229, ACH-002230, ACH-002233, ACH-002234, ACH-002239, ACH-002243, ACH-002247, ACH-002249, ACH-002250, ACH-002257, ACH-002261, ACH-002263, ACH-002265, ACH-002269, ACH-002278, ACH-002280, ACH-002282, ACH-002283, ACH-002284, ACH-002285, ACH-002294, ACH-002295, ACH-002296, ACH-002297, ACH-002298, ACH-002304, ACH-002305, ACH-002399, ACH-002874, ACH-002875"
```

Not all cell lines contain RNA and/or protein expression profiles, and
not all proteins were detected by mass spectrometer. (Details on data
generation can be found on the [DepMap
site](https://depmap.org/portal/).)

``` r
# Get protein expression
ARID1A_prot_expr <- extract_protein_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_groups_subset$DepMap_ID,
  Input_genes = "ARID1A",
  data_dir = greta_data_dir)

# Produces an error message since ARID1A protein data is not available
```

Using Welch’s t-test, we can check to see whether *ARID1A* RNA
expression (in TPM) is significantly reduced in `ARID1A_HomDel` cell
lines compared to `Controls`.

``` r
# Append groups and test differential expression
ARID1A_rna_expr <- left_join(
  ARID1A_rna_expr,
  ARID1A_groups_subset %>% select(DepMap_ID, Group)) %>%
  mutate(Group = fct_relevel(Group,"Control")) # show Control group first
#> Joining, by = "DepMap_ID"

# T-test 
t.test(ARID1A_8289 ~ Group, ARID1A_rna_expr)
#> 
#>  Welch Two Sample t-test
#> 
#> data:  ARID1A_8289 by Group
#> t = 2.5764, df = 22.873, p-value = 0.01692
#> alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Control and group ARID1A_HomDel is not equal to 0

  geom_boxplot()
```

### Perform *in silico* genetic screen

After determining cell lines in the `ARID1A_HomDel` group has
statistically significant reduction in RNA expression compared to
`Control` cell lines, the next step is to perform a *in silico* genetic
screen using `screen_results()`. This uses the dependency probabilities
(or **“lethality probabilities”**) generated from DepMap’s genome-wide
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen.

**Lethality probabilities** range from 0.0 to 1.0 and is quantified for
each gene knock out in every cancer cell line screened (There are 18,334
genes targeted in 739 cancer cell lines). A gene knock out with a
lethality probability of 0.0 indicates a non-essential for the cell
line, and a gene knock out with a 1.0 indicates an essential gene (ie.
very lethal). Details can be found in [Meyers, R., et al.,
2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3984)

At its core, `screen_results()` performs multiple Mann-Whitney U tests,
comparing lethality probabilities of each targeted gene between mutant
and control groups. This generates a data frame with the following
columns:

-   `GeneName_ID` - Hugo symbol with NCBI gene ID
-   `GeneNames` - Hugo symbol
-   `_median, _mean, _sd, _iqr` - Control and mutant group’s median,
    mean, standard deviation (sd), and interquartile range (iqr) of
    dependency probabilities. Dependency probabilities range from zero
    to one, where one indicates a essential gene (ie. KO of gene was
    lethal) and zero indicates a non-essential gene (KO of gene was not
    lethal)
-   `Pval` - P-value from Mann Whitney U test between control and mutant
    groups.
-   `Adj_pval` - BH-adjusted P-value.
-   `log2FC_by_median` - Log2 normalized median fold change of
    dependency probabilities (mutant / control).
-   `log2FC_by_mean` - Log2 normalized mean fold change of dependency
    probabilities (mutant / control).
-   `CliffDelta` - Cliff’s delta non-parametric effect size between
    mutant and control dependency probabilities. Ranges between -1 to 1.
-   `dip_pval` - Hartigan’s dip test p-value. Tests whether distribution
    of mutant dependency probability is unimodel. If dip test is
    rejected (p-value \< 0.05), this indicates that there is a
    multimodel dependency probability distribution and that there may be
    another factor contributing to this separation.
-   `Interaction_score` - Combined value generated from signed p-values:
    -log10(Pval) \* sign(log2FC_by_median). Negative scores indicate
    lethal genetic interaction, and positive scores indicate alleviating
    genetic interaction.

> **Warning** This process may take minutes depending on the number of
> cores assigned. In our example below, `GI_screen()` took \~2 hours to
> process.

``` r
ARID1A_mutant_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)
ARID1A_control_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("Control")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)

# This can take several hours depending on number of lines/cores used. Best to run this overnight.
screen_results <- GI_screen(
  control_IDs = ARID1A_control_IDs, 
  mutant_IDs = ARID1A_mutant_IDs,
  core_num = 5, # depends on how many cores you have  
  output_dir = greta_output_dir, # Will save your results here as well as in the variable
  data_dir = greta_data_dir,
  test = FALSE) # use TRUE to run a short test to make sure all will run overnight.
```

We can quickly determine whether any lethal genetic interactions were
predicted by `GRETA`. We use a `Pval` cut off of 0.05 and rank based on
the `Interaction_score`.

``` r
screen_results %>% 
  filter(Pval < 0.05) %>%
  arrange(-Interaction_score) %>% 
  select(GeneNames:Mutant_median, Pval, Interaction_score) %>% head
#> # A tibble: 6 × 5
#>   GeneNames Control_median Mutant_median     Pval Interaction_score
#>   <chr>              <dbl>         <dbl>    <dbl>             <dbl>
#> 1 ARID1B           0.0579         0.515  6.84e-10              9.16
#> 2 CCDC110          0.0165         0.0303 3.54e- 4              3.45
#> 3 APOO             0.0168         0.0283 9.61e- 4              3.02
#> 4 NHS              0.0352         0.0539 9.69e- 4              3.01
#> 5 SLC66A2          0.00793        0.0134 1.06e- 3              2.98
#> 6 ATXN7L1          0.0138         0.0259 1.78e- 3              2.75
```

We immediately see that *ARID1B*, a known synthetic lethal interaction
of *ARID1A*, was a the top of this list.

### Visualize screen results

Finally once the *in silico* screen is complete, results can be quickly
visualized using `plot_screen()`. Positive genetic interaction scores
indicate potential synthetic lethal genetic interactors, and negative
scores indicate potential alleviating genetic interactors. As expected,
we identified *ARID1B* as a synthetic lethal interactor of *ARID1A*.

``` r
# Visualize results, turn on gene labels, 
# and label three genes each that are predicted to have 
# lethal and alleviating genetic interactions, respectively

plot_screen(result_df = screen_results, 
            label_genes = TRUE, 
            label_n = 3)
#> Warning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* co-essential genes

Perturbing genes that function in same/synergistic pathways or in the
same complex are said to show similar fitness effects, and these that
show effects are considered to be “co-essential”. The strategy of
mapping co-essential gene have been used by several studies to attribute
functions to previously annotated genes as well as to identify a novel
subunit of a large complex ([Wainberg et
al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00840-z); [Pan et
al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.04.011)).

Given that ARID1A is known subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex
([Mashtalir et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.032)),
we expect that members of the SWI/SNF complex would share
co-essentiality with *ARID1A*. This example will demonstrate how we can
map *ARID1A*’s co-essential gene network using `GRETA`.

## Identifying genes with highest correlation coefficients

To determine co-essential genes, we will perform multiple Pearson
correlation coefficient analyses between *ARID1A* KO effects and the KO
effects of all 18,333 genes. A cut off will be determined by calculating
the inflection point of the ranked coefficient curve. As expected find
SWI/SNF subunit encoding genes, *SMARCE1* and *SMARCB1*, as the top two
co-essential genes.

> **Warning** This process may take minutes depending on the number of
> cores assigned. In our example below, `coessential_map()` +
> `get_inflection_points()` took \~30 minutes to process.

``` r
# Map co-essential genes
coess_df <- coessential_map(
  Input_gene = "ARID1A", 
  core_num = 5, 
  data_dir = greta_data_dir, 
  output_dir = greta_output_dir,
  test = FALSE) # use TRUE to run a short test to make sure this process will run.

# Calculate inflection points of positive and negative curve using co-essential gene results.
coess_inflection_df <- get_inflection_points(coess_df)
```

Next, we annotate the data frame containing the co-essential network
data and visualize.

``` r
# Combine and annotate data frame containing co-essential genes
coess_annotated_df <- annotate_coessential_df(coess_df, coess_inflection_df)

plot_coessential_genes(
  result_df = coess_annotated_df, 
  inflection_df = coess_inflection_df,
  label_genes = TRUE, # Should gene names be labeled?
  label_n = 3) # Number of genes to display from each end
```

We also see that the top ten *ARID1A* co-essential genes include eight
known SWI/SNF subunits, namely *ARID1A*, *SMARCB1*, *SMARCE1*,
*SMARCC1*, *SS18*, *DPF2*, *SMARCC2*, and *SMARCD2*.
