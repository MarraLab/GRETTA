## Workflows

### Genetic interaction mapping

1.  Install `GRETA` and download accompanying data.
2.  Select mutant cell lines that carry mutations in the gene of
    interest and control cell lines.
    -   (optional specifications) disease type, disease subtype, amino
        acid change.
3.  Determine differential expression between mutant and control cell
    line groups.
    -   (optional but recommended).
4.  Perform *in silico* genetic screen.
5.  Visualize results.

### Co-essential network mapping

1.  Install `GRETA` and download accompanying data.
2.  Run correlation coefficient analysis.
3.  Calculate inflection points of negative/positive curve to determine
    a threshold.
4.  Apply threshold.
5.  Visualize results.

## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* genetic interactions

*ARID1A* encodes a member of the chromatin remodeling SWItch/Sucrose
Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex and is a frequently mutated gene in
cancer. It is known that *ARID1A* and its homolog, *ARID1B*, are
synthetic lethal to one another: The dual loss of ARID1A and its
homolog, ARID1B, in a cell is lethal; however, the loss of either gene
alone is not ([Helming et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3480)).
This example will demonstrate how we can identify synthetic lethal
interactors of *ARID1A* using `GRETA` and predict this known
interaction.

For this example you will need to call the following libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
#> ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──
#> ✔ ggplot2 3.3.6     ✔ purrr   0.3.4
#> ✔ tibble  3.1.8     ✔ dplyr   1.0.9
#> ✔ tidyr   1.2.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
#> ✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1
#> ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
#> ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
#> ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
library(GRETA)
```

Then, assign a variable that points to where the `.rda` files are
stored.

``` r
GRETA_data_dir <- "/path/to/GRETA_project/data/"
```

### Exploring cell lines

One way to explore cell lines that are available in DepMap is through
their [portal](https://depmap.org/portal/). However, there are some
simple built-in methods in GRETA to provide users with a way to glimpse
the data using the series of `list_available` functions:
`list_available_mutations()`, `list_available_cancer_types()`,
`list_available_cancer_subtypes()`

Current DepMap data used by default is version 20Q1, which contains
whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing annotations for `1775`
cancer cell lines (`1270` cell lines with RNA-seq data, `378` cell lines
with quantitative proteomics data, and `739` cell lines with CRISPR-Cas9
knockout screen data)

``` r
# Find ARID1A hotspot mutations detected in all cell lines
list_available_mutations(Gene = "ARID1A", Is_hotspot = TRUE, data_dir = GRETA_data_dir) 
```

``` r
# List all available cancer types

### Selecting mutant and control cell line groups

As default `select_cell_lines()` will identify cancer cell lines with
loss-of-function alterations in the gene specified and group them into
six different groups.

Loss-of-function alterations include variants that are annotated as:
`"Nonsense_Mutation", "Frame_Shift_Ins", "Splice_Site", "De_novo_Start_OutOfFrame", "Frame_Shift_Del", "Start_Codon_SNP", "Start_Codon_Del",`
and `"Start_Codon_Ins"`. Copy number alterations are also taken into
consideration and group as `"Deep_del", "Loss", "Neutral",` or
`"Amplified"`.

The cell line groups assigned by default are:

-   `Control` cell lines do not harbor any single nucleotide variations
    (SNVs) or insertions and deletions (InDels) with a neutral copy
    number (CN).
-   `HomDel` cell lines harbor one or more homozygous deleterious SNVs
    or have deep CN loss.
-   `T-HetDel` cell lines harbor two or more heterozygous deleterious
    SNVs/InDels with neutral or CN loss.
-   `HetDel` cell lines harbor one heterozygous deleterious SNV/InDel
    with neutral CN, or no SNV/InDel with CN loss.
-   `Amplified` cell lines harbor no SNVs/InDels with increased CN.
-   `Others` cell lines harbor deleterious SNVs with increased CN.

``` r
ARID1A_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)
#> Selecting mutant groups for: ARID1A in all cancer cell lines

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_groups, Group)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 2
#>   Group               n
#>   <chr>           <int>
#> 1 Amplified          24
#> 2 ARID1A_HetDel     105
#> 3 ARID1A_HomDel      13
#> 4 ARID1A_T-HetDel    21
#> 5 Control           529
#> 6 Others             47
```

#### Optional filter for specific cancer types

``` r
# Find pancreatic cancer cell lines with ARID1A mutations
ARID1A_pancr_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", 
                                         Input_disease = "Pancreatic Cancer",
                                         data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)
#> Selecting mutant groups for: ARID1A in Pancreatic Cancer,  cell lines

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_pancr_groups, Group)
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   Group               n
#>   <chr>           <int>
#> 1 ARID1A_HetDel       7
#> 2 ARID1A_HomDel       4
#> 3 ARID1A_T-HetDel     1
#> 4 Control            18
#> 5 Others              1
```

### Check for differential expression

Of the three mutant cancer cell line groups `ARID1A_HomDel`,
`ARID1A_T-HetDel`, and `ARID1A_HetDel`, cancer cell lines with
`ARID1A_HomDel` mutations are most likely to result in a loss or reduced
expression of *ARID1A*. Therefore, we want to check whether cell lines
in `ARID1A_HomDel` mutant group have significantly less *ARID1A* RNA or
protein expression compared to control cell lines.

``` r
# Select only HomDel and Control cell lines
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel", "Control"))

# Get RNA expression 
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna <- extract_rna_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls$DepMap_ID, 
  Input_genes = "ARID1A",
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)
#> [1] "Following sample did not contain profile data: ACH-001151, ACH-001685, ACH-001956"
```

Not all cell lines contain RNA and/or protein expression profiles, and
not all proteins were detected by mass spectrometer. (Details on data
generation can be found on the [DepMap
site](https://depmap.org/portal/).)

``` r
# Get protein expression
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_protein <- extract_protein_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls$DepMap_ID,
  Input_genes = "ARID1A",
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir)

# Produces an error message since ARID1A protein data is not available
```

Using Welch’s t-test, we can check to see whether *ARID1A* RNA
expression (in TPM) is significantly reduced in `ARID1A_HomDel` cell
lines compared to `Controls`.

``` r
# Append groups and test differential expression
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna <- left_join(
  ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna,
  ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls %>% select(DepMap_ID, Group)) %>%
  mutate(Group = fct_relevel(Group,"Control")) # show Control group first
#> Joining, by = "DepMap_ID"

# T-test 
t.test(ARID1A_8289 ~ Group, ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna)
#> 
#>  Welch Two Sample t-test
#> 
#> data:  ARID1A_8289 by Group
#> t = 5.4354, df = 12.591, p-value = 0.0001276
#> alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
#> 95 percent confidence interval:
#>  0.7574242 1.7621880
#> sample estimates:
#>       mean in group Control mean in group ARID1A_HomDel 
#>                    4.816896                    3.557090

# plot 
ggplot(ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna, aes(x = Group, y = ARID1A_8289)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Perform *in silico* genetic screen

After determining cell lines in the `ARID1A_HomDel` group has
statistically significant reduction in RNA expression compared to
`Control` cell lines, the next step is to perform a *in silico* genetic
screen using `screen_results()`. This uses the dependency probabilities
(or **“lethality probabilities”**) generated from DepMap’s genome-wide
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen.

**Lethality probabilities** range from 0.0 to 1.0 and is quantified for
each gene knock out in every cancer cell line screened (There are 18,334
genes targeted in 739 cancer cell lines). A gene knock out with a
lethality probability of 0.0 indicates a non-essential for the cell
line, and a gene knock out with a 1.0 indicates an essential gene (ie.
very lethal). Details can be found in [Meyers, R., et al.,
2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3984)

At its core, `screen_results()` performs multiple Mann-Whitney U tests,
comparing lethality probabilities of each targeted gene between mutant
and control groups. This generates a data frame with the following
columns:

-   `GeneName_ID` - Hugo symbol with NCBI gene ID
-   `GeneNames` - Hugo symbol
-   `_median, _mean, _sd, _iqr` - Control and mutant group’s median,
    mean, standard deviation (sd), and interquartile range (iqr) of
    dependency probabilities. Dependency probabilities range from zero
    to one, where one indicates a essential gene (ie. KO of gene was
    lethal) and zero indicates a non-essential gene (KO of gene was not
    lethal)
-   `Pval` - P-value from Mann Whitney U test between control and mutant
    groups.
-   `Adj_pval` - BH-adjusted P-value.
-   `log2FC_by_median` - Log2 normalized median fold change of
    dependency probabilities (mutant / control).
-   `log2FC_by_mean` - Log2 normalized mean fold change of dependency
    probabilities (mutant / control).
-   `CliffDelta` - Cliff’s delta non-parametric effect size between
    mutant and control dependency probabilities. Ranges between -1 to 1.
-   `dip_pval` - Hartigan’s dip test p-value. Tests whether distribution
    of mutant dependency probability is unimodel. If dip test is
    rejected (p-value \< 0.05), this indicates that there is a
    multimodel dependency probability distribution and that there may be
    another factor contributing to this separation.
-   `Interaction_score` - Combined value generated from signed p-values:
    -log10(Pval) \* sign(log2FC_by_median). Negative scores indicate
    lethal genetic interaction, and positive scores indicate alleviating
    genetic interaction.

``` r
ARID1A_mutant_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)
ARID1A_control_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("Control")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)

# This can take several hours depending on number of lines/cores used. Best to run this overnight.
screen_results <- GI_screen(
  control_IDs = ARID1A_control_IDs, 
  mutant_IDs = ARID1A_mutant_IDs,
  core_num = 5, # depends on how many cores you have  
  output_dir = "path/to/results/folder/", # Will save your results here as well as in the variable
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir,
  test = FALSE) # use TRUE to run a short test to make sure all will run overnight.
```

We can quickly determine whether any lethal genetic interactions were
predicted by `GRETA`. We use a `Pval` cut off of 0.05 and rank based on
the `Interaction_score`.

``` r
screen_results %>% 
  filter(Pval < 0.05) %>%
  arrange(-Interaction_score) %>% 
  select(GeneNames:Mutant_median, Pval, Interaction_score) %>% head
#> # A tibble: 6 × 5
#>   GeneNames Control_median Mutant_median         Pval Interaction_score
#>   <chr>              <dbl>         <dbl>        <dbl>             <dbl>
#> 1 ARID1B           0.0364        0.590   0.0000000342              7.47
#> 2 OR2M3            0.00912       0.0279  0.000255                  3.59
#> 3 C1QTNF5          0.0794        0.253   0.000334                  3.48
#> 4 LSM1             0.0273        0.112   0.000548                  3.26
#> 5 ONECUT1          0.00116       0.00451 0.00107                   2.97
#> 6 ANP32B           0.0160        0.0566  0.00119                   2.92
```

We immediately see that *ARID1B*, a known synthetic lethal interaction
of *ARID1A*, was a the top of this list.

### Visualize screen results

Finally once the *in silico* screen is complete, results can be quickly
visualized using `plot_screen()`. Positive genetic interaction scores
indicate potential synthetic lethal genetic interactors, and negative
scores indicate potential alleviating genetic interactors. As expected,
we identified *ARID1B* as a synthetic lethal interactor of *ARID1A*.

``` r
# Visualize results, turn on gene labels, 
# and label three genes each that are predicted to have 
# lethal and alleviating genetic interactions, respectively

plot_screen(result_df = screen_results, 
            label_genes = TRUE, 
            label_n = 3)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot-1.png" width="100%" />

## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* co-essential genes

Perturbing genes that function in same/synergistic pathways or in the
same complex are said to show similar fitness effects, and these that
show effects are considered to be “co-essential”. The strategy of
mapping co-essential gene have been used by several studies to attribute
functions to previously annotated genes as well as to identify a novel
subunit of a large complex ([Wainberg et
al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00840-z); [Pan et
al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.04.011)).

Given that ARID1A is known subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex
([Mashtalir et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.032)),
we expect that members of the SWI/SNF complex would share
co-essentiality with *ARID1A*. This example will demonstrate how we can
map *ARID1A*’s co-essential gene network using `GRETA`.

## Identifying genes with highest correlation coefficients

To determine co-essential genes, we will perform multiple Pearson
correlation coefficient analyses between *ARID1A* KO effects and the KO
effects of all 18,333 genes. A cut off will be determined by calculating
the inflection point of the ranked coefficient curve. As expected find
SWI/SNF subunit encoding genes, *SMARCE1* and *SMARCB1*, as the top two
co-essential genes.

``` r
# Map co-essential genes
coess_df <- coessential_map(
  Input_gene = "ARID1A", 
  core_num = 5, 
  data_dir = GRETA_data_dir, 
  output_dir = "path/to/results/folder/",
  test = FALSE)

# Calculate inflection points of positive and negative curve using co-essential gene results.
coess_inflection_df <- get_inflection_points(coess_df)
```

Next, we annotate the data frame containing the co-essential network
data and visualize.

``` r
# Combine and annotate data frame containing co-essential genes
coess_annotated_df <- annotate_coessential_df(coess_df, coess_inflection_df)

plot_coessential_genes(
  result_df = coess_annotated_df, 
  inflection_df = coess_inflection_df,
  label_genes = TRUE, # Should gene names be labeled?
  label_n = 3) # Number of genes to display from each end
```

<img src="man/figures/README-combine_n_visualize-1.png" width="100%" />

We also see that the top ten *ARID1A* co-essential genes include eight
known SWI/SNF subunits, namely *ARID1A*, *SMARCE1*, *SMARCB1*,
*SMARCC1*, *DPF2*, *SS18*, *SMARCC2*, and *SMARCD2*.

``` r
# Show top 10 co-essential genes. 
coess_annotated_df %>% arrange(Rank) %>% head(10)
