GINIR is an R package that leverages data generated by the [Cancer
Dependency Map (DepMap) project](https://depmap.org/portal/) to identify
cancer cell lines with mutations of interest and perform in-silico
genetic knockout screens. A manuscript describing the process is being
prepared.

Current DepMap data used by default is version 20Q1, which was
downloaded through the DepMap data portal. The data was distributed and
used under the terms and conditions of [CC Attribution 4.0
license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Installation

You can install GINIR from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ytakemon/GINIR")
```

## Workflow

1.  Select mutant cell lines that carry mutations in the gene of
    interest and control cell lines.
      - (optional specifications) disease type, disease subtype, amino
        acid change
2.  Determine differential expression between mutant and control cell
    line groups.
      - (optional but recommended)
3.  Perform *in silico* genetic screen.
4.  Visualize results

## Example: Identifying *ARID1A* genetic interactions

*ARID1A* encodes a member of the chromatic remodeling SWItch/Sucrose
Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex and is a frequently mutated gene in
cancer. It is known that *ARID1A* and its homolog, *ARID1B*, are
synthetic lethal to one another: The dual loss of ARID1A and its
homolog, ARID1B, in a cell is lethal; however, the loss of either gene
alone is not ([Helming et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3480)).
This example will demonstrate how we can identify synthetic lethal
interactors of *ARID1A* using `GINIR` and predict this known
interaction.

For this example you will need to call the following libraries

``` r
library(GINIR)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Exploring cell lines

One way to explore cell lines that are available in DepMap is through
their [portal](https://depmap.org/portal/). However, there are some
simple built-in methods in GINI to provide users with a way to glimpse
the data using the series of `list_available` functions:
`list_available_mutations()`, `list_available_cancer_types()`,
`list_available_cancer_subtypes()`

Current DepMap data used by default is version 20Q1, which contains
whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing annotations for `1775`
cancer cell lines (`1270` cell lines with RNA-seq data, `378` cell lines
with quantitative proteomics data, and `739` cell lines with CRISPR-Cas9
knockout screen data)

``` r
# Find hotspot mutations in TP53
list_available_mutations(Gene = "TP53", Is_hotspot = TRUE) 
```

``` r
# List all available cancer types
list_available_cancer_types()

# List all available cancer subtypes
list_available_cancer_subtypes(input_disease = "Lung Cancer")
```

### Selecting mutant and control cell line groups

As default `select_cell_lines()` will identify cancer cell lines with
loss-of-function alterations in the gene specified and group them into
six different groups.

Loss-of-function alterations include variants that are annotated as:
`"Nonsense_Mutation", "Frame_Shift_Ins", "Splice_Site",
"De_novo_Start_OutOfFrame", "Frame_Shift_Del", "Start_Codon_SNP",
"Start_Codon_Del",` and `"Start_Codon_Ins"`. Copy number alterations are
also taken into consideration and group as `"Deep_del", "Loss",
"Neutral",` or `"Amplified"`.

The cell line groups assigned by default are:

  - `Control` cell lines do not harbor any single nucleotide variations
    (SNVs) or insertions and deletions (InDels) with a neutral copy
    number (CN).
  - `HomDel` cell lines harbor one or more homozygous deleterious SNVs
    or have deep CN loss.
  - `T-HetDel` cell lines harbor two or more heterozygous deleterious
    SNVs/InDels with neutral or CN loss.
  - `HetDel` cell lines harbor one heterozygous deleterious SNV/InDel
    with neutral CN, or no SNV/InDel with CN loss.
  - `Amplified` cell lines harbor no SNVs/InDels with increased CN.
  - `Others` cell lines harbor deleterious SNVs with increased CN.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ARID1A_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A")

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_groups, Group)
```

#### Optional filter for specific cancer types

``` r
# Find pancreatic cancer cell lines with ARID1A mutations
ARID1A_pancr_groups <- select_cell_lines(Input_gene = "ARID1A", Input_disease = "Pancreatic Cancer")

# Show number of cell lines in each group 
count(ARID1A_pancr_groups, Group)
```

### Check for differential expression

Of the three mutant cancer cell line groups `ARID1A_HomDel`,
`ARID1A_T-HetDel`, and `ARID1A_HetDel`, cancer cell lines with
`ARID1A_HomDel` mutations are most likely to result in a loss or reduced
expression of *ARID1A*. Therefore, we want to check whether cell lines
in `ARID1A_HomDel` mutant group have significantly less *ARID1A* RNA or
protein expression compared to control cell lines.

``` r
# Select only HomDel and Control cell lines
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel", "Control"))

# Get RNA expression 
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna <- extract_rna_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls$DepMap_ID, 
  Input_genes = "ARID1A")
```

Not all cell lines contain RNA and/or protein expression profiles, and
not all proteins were detected by mass spectrometer. (Details on data
generation can be found on the [DepMap
site](https://depmap.org/portal/).)

``` r
# Get protein expression
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_protein <- extract_protein_expr(
  Input_samples = ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls$DepMap_ID,
  Input_genes = "ARID1A")

# Produces an error message since ARID1A protein data is not available
```

Using Welch’s t-test, we can check to see whether *ARID1A* RNA
expression (in TPM) is significantly reduced in `ARID1A_HomDel` cell
lines compared to `Controls`.

``` r
# Append groups and test differential expression
ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna <- left_join(ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna,
                                              ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls %>% select(DepMap_ID, Group))

# T-test 
t.test(ARID1A_8289 ~ Group, ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna)

# plot 
ggplot(ARID1A_HomDel_muts_and_ctrls_rna, aes(x = Group, y = ARID1A_8289)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Perform *in silico* genetic screen

After determining cell lines in the `ARID1A_HomDel` group has
statistically significant reduction in RNA expression compared to
`Control` cell lines, the next step is to perform a *in silico* genetic
screen using `screen_results()`. This uses the dependency probabilities
(or **“lethality probabilities”**) generated from DepMap’s genome-wide
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen.

**Lethality probabilities** range from 0.0 to 1.0 and is quantified for
each gene knock out in every cancer cell line screened (There are 18,334
genes targeted in 739 cancer cell lines). A gene knock out with a
lethality probability of 0.0 indicates a non-essential for the cell
line, and a gene knock out with a 1.0 indicates an essential gene (ie.
very lethal). Details can be found in [Meyers, R., et
al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3984)

At its core, `screen_results()` performs multiple Mann-Whitney U tests,
comparing lethality probabilities of each targeted gene between mutant
and control groups. This generates a data frame with the following
columns:

  - `GeneName_ID` - Hugo symbol with NCBI gene ID
  - `GeneNames` - Hugo symbol
  - `_median, _mean, _sd, _iqr` - Control and mutant group’s median,
    mean, standard deviation (sd), and interquartile range (iqr) of
    dependency probabilities. Dependency probabilities range from zero
    to one, where one indicates a essential gene (ie. KO of gene was
    lethal) and zero indicates a non-essential gene (KO of gene was not
    lethal)
  - `Pval` - P-value from Mann Whitney U test between control and mutant
    groups.
  - `Adj_pval` - BH-adjusted P-value.
  - `log2FC_by_median` - Log2 normalized median fold change of
    dependency probabilities (mutant / control).
  - `log2FC_by_mean` - Log2 normalized mean fold change of dependency
    probabilities (mutant / control).
  - `CliffDelta` - Cliff’s delta non-parametric effect size between
    mutant and control dependency probabilities. Ranges between -1 to 1.
  - `dip_pval` - Hartigan’s dip test p-value. Tests whether distribution
    of mutant dependency probability is unimodel. If dip test is
    rejected (p-value \< 0.05), this indicates that there is a
    multimodel dependency probability distribution and that there may be
    another factor contributing to this separation.
  - `Interaction_score` - Combined value generated from signed p-values:
    -log10(Pval) \* sign(log2FC\_by\_median)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ARID1A_mutant_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("ARID1A_HomDel")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)
ARID1A_control_IDs <- ARID1A_groups %>% filter(Group %in% c("Control")) %>% pull(DepMap_ID)

# This can take several hours depending on number of lines/cores used. Best to run this overnight.
screen_results <- GINI_screen(
  control_IDs = ARID1A_mutant_IDs, 
  mutant_IDs = ARID1A_control_IDs, 
  core_num = 5, # depends on how many cores you have  
  output_dir = "path/to/results/folder/", # Will save your results here as well as in the variable
  test = FALSE) # use TRUE to run a short test to make sure all will run overnight.
```

``` r
screen_results %>% arrange(-Interaction_score) %>% head()
```

### Visualize screen results

Finally once the *in silico* screen is complete, results can be quickly
visualized using `plot_screen()`. Positive genetic interaction scores
indicate potential synthetic lethal genetic interactors, and negative
scores indicate potential alleviating genetic interactors.

``` r
# Visualize results, turn on gene labels, 
# and label three genes each that are predicted to have 
# lethal and alleviating genetic interactions, respectively

plot_screen(result_df = screen_results, 
            label_genes = TRUE, 
            label_n = 3)
```
