#' @title Sample GINI screen result for ARID1A KO pan cancer cell lines
#'
#' @description A sample data set containing the results of a screen conducted in cancer cell lines with
#' loss-of-function alterations in ARID1A (HomDel) generated using `GINI_screen()`. As reported in previous literature
#' ARID1A and ARID1B have synthetic lethal interaction (Helming et al.; doi: 10.1038/nm.3480; PMID:24562383), 
#' thus gene with the highest interaction score is ARID1B.
