Description: Genetic inteRaction and EssenTiality mApper, or `GRETA`, performs in-silico genetic screens and generate essentiality network maps. 
  To do this, `GRETA` leverages publicly available data generated by the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project. Users can define versions of DepMap 
  to analyze, and can also query DepMap data directly from the tool. A pre-print with detailed explanations on `GRETA` can be found here:
